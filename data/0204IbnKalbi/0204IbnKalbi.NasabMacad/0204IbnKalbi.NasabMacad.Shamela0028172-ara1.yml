90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- One typo could be found in almost all pages.
            2-Occasional missing lines (like: two missing lines in Page 58, a
            missing line in page 93, and two lines in page 225). 3- I tagged the
            names as ### $ when just one name appears at the beginning of a sentence
            in complete form and I tried to tag all the names that could be tagged
            structurally (to avoid reworking); however, there are a lot of other
            names inside the sentences that could not be tagged structurally.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
