90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The link in VERS#LINKS (which is exactly the same
    as the JK edition) leads you to a payment-based website and you must
    have an account to see the contents. If you can’t access this link, two
    other editions of the book that are accessible on the internet can be
    found here: https://archive.org/details/FP77409/mode/1up;
    https://www.almeshkat.net/book/4095. 2- The sign “&” is placed instead
    of “صلی الله” in the text, and sometimes redundantly at the end of
    sentences. Moreover, the pipe symbols (|) inside the text signify the
    end of the sentences in the PDF and must be deleted. 3- The text
    consists of four sections (“جزء”). I did not tag the beginning of these
    sections since they have no effect on the structure of the text
    (nevertheless, there is an editorial section at the beginning of the
    sections and they can be found easily). 4- There is a descriptive table
    of contents at the end of the book which cannot be used for tagging the
    text; however it is useful for understanding the structure and contents
    of the text. 5- The editorial sections (except the last one) are the
    notes of the scribe.
