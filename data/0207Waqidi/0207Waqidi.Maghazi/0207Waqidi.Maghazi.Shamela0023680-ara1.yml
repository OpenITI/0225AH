90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH, SPL, PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: PV tagged the "al-juz' al-awwal" statement and the riwāya of
            the book
            as PARATEXT (as HRH had done with the subsequent juz' statements).
            NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 15022
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
