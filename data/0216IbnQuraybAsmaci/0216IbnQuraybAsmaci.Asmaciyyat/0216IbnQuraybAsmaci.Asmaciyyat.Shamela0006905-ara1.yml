90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Annotated by unknown annotator, updated and validated
            by Gowaart. Text is  now structured but is not very clean: it contains
            some html-formatting and layout-features for  poetry (lines are numbered
            and bracketed). The edition found is a Beirut reprint of the original
            Egyptian printing.
            NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): A few titles that were tagged incompletely
            corrected.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
