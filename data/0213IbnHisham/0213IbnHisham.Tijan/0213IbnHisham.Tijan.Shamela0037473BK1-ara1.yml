90#VERS#COMMENT##: The original digital text contains two separate books:
            Ibn Hishām's reworking of Wahb b. Munabbih's Kitāb al-Tījān
            (0213IbnHisham.Tijan) and another work (0213IbnHisham.AkhbarIbnSarya),
            containing traditions related by the (possibly fictitious)
            ʿUbayd/ʿAbīd Ibn Sharya al-Juhrumī to the Caliph Muʿāwiya,
            that is appended to the Kitāb al-Tījān in some but not all manuscripts.
            Krenkow (Islamic Culture 2.2 (July 1928), p. 234-236) considers the latter
            a separate work (probably) redacted by Ibn Hishām, although Ibn Hishām is not
            mentioned in the riwāya of the work.
            PV split the original text file into two separate files.
    All paratextual elements
